# Social Card

## Description
This is more of a component than a full-blown app, but it’s a good place to start.

Variations of this UI can be found all over the web – Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Airbnb, Redfin, and so on – and it serves as a solid building block for the sort of app where you want to display an image + some data.

It’s also good practice for breaking down a UI into React components.

Once you have a single SocialCard component rendering, try making a list of them with some fake data.
